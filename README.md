# Pymaceuticals_Matplotlib

As a data analyst at the company dedicated to create distinct types of drugs for treatments of cancer, we've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. In this project was necessary by the executive team to generate all the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. Also was asked for a top-level summary of the study results.
